In the first study, we analyzed tabular clinical data from patients using seven machine learning models to predict the risk of heart attacks. In the second research project, we evaluated ten machine learning and deep learning models to estimate the risk of Parkinson's disease, using IMU sensor data captured during straight-line walking tests. We achieved promising results, reaching up to 93.79% accuracy. Currently, an article with the findings of this research is in the process of being published in ACM journals."

To achieve this, ten machine learning and deep learning models were evaluated: MLP Network, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Time Series Transformer, LSTM, and VGG-16 with transfer learning. The LSTM model delivered the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.79%.
